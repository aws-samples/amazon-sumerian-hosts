# Amazon Sumerian Hosts

For a general introduction to Amazon Sumerian Hosts and examples of how to integrate with this package, refer to the [primary repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sumerian-hosts)

Amazon Sumerian Hosts is an experimental open source project that aims to make it easy to create interactive animated 3D characters that can be rendered on the Web and leverage AWS Services such as [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/). The core API provides an abstraction layer so that these can be extended to support the Web rendering engine of your choice. 

Refer to the [API Documentation](https://aws-samples.github.io/amazon-sumerian-hosts/) for more detailed information on the classes and methods available. Amazon Sumerian Hosts is a published [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package, so alternatively you can install in an existing Node.js project by running `npm install --save-dev @amazon-sumerian-hosts/core`. If you'd like to pull the gitub repository and create your own build, see [Building the Repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sumerian-hosts/blob/mainline2.0/README.md#building-the-repository) for prerequisites and instructions on how to do that.
