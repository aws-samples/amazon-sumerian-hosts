## Experience

**SumerianHosts** is an open source project that allows customers to leverage the power of Sumerian Hosts in other Javascript environments, such as three.js and Babylon.js. There will be a core build for generic projects as well as a separate build for each environment. The core build will not contain any visuals, it will give customers text to speech capabilities that message speechmarks from Polly and a way to access LexRuntime. Builds for specific environments will also include triggering animations using the Polly speechmarks and POI functionality. Each environment build will come with an example showing a character model loaded into the environment and using Host features. The project will also contain a series of Host glTF assets for customers to use if they choose not to provide their own assets. The main 8 hosts from Sumerian will be made available, as well as the hoodie, polo shirt and t-shirt assets for each gender.
